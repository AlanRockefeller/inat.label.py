## Features

- Fetches observation data directly from the iNaturalist API
- Supports multiple observation IDs or URLs as input
- Generates labels with key information including:
  - Scientific Name (in italics)
  - Common Name
  - iNaturalist Observation Number
  - iNaturalist URL
  - Location
  - GPS Coordinates (with accuracy)
  - Date Observed
  - Observer Name
  - DNA Barcode ITS (if available)
  - GenBank Accession Number (if available)
  - Provisional Species Name (if available)
  - Notes
- Outputs labels to console for quick viewing
- Creates formatted RTF files for high-quality printing
- Handles special characters and formatting (e.g., italics for scientific names, proper display of Â± symbol)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inat-herbarium-label-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd inat-herbarium-label-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requests python-dateutil beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing one or more iNaturalist observation IDs or URLs:

```
python inat.label.py <observation_number_or_url> [<observation_number_or_url> ...]
```

To generate an RTF file, use the `--rtf` option:

```
python inat.label.py <observation_number_or_url> [<observation_number_or_url> ...] --rtf <filename.rtf>
```

### Examples:

1. Generate label for a single observation:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751
   ```

2. Generate labels for multiple observations:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751 147249599 https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/106191917
   ```

3. Generate labels and save to an RTF file:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751 147249599 --rtf two_labels.rtf
   ```

## Output

The script generates herbarium labels with the following information:

- Scientific Name (in bold italics)
- Common Name (which is occasionally set to the scientific name, and if it's a higher level taxonomic rank it will be more complete than what is in the Scientific Name field)
- iNaturalist Observation Number
- iNaturalist URL
- Location
- GPS Coordinates (with accuracy if available)
- Date Observed
- Observer Name
- DNA Barcode ITS (if available)
- GenBank Accession Number (if available)
- Provisional Species Name (if available)
- Mobile or Traditional Photography (if available)
- Mushroom Observer URL (if available, URL formatted for brevity)
- Observation Notes (HTML formatting is preserved in RTF output)

When using the RTF output option, the labels are formatted for optimal readability and professional appearance.

## Dependencies
