## Features

- Fetches observation data using the iNaturalist API
- Supports multiple observation IDs or URLs as input
- Generates labels with key information including:
  - Scientific Name (in italics)
  - Common Name (if different from scientific name)
  - iNaturalist Observation Number
  - iNaturalist URL (in case the herbarium manager doesn't know how to create iNaturalist URL's)
  - Location (in text format)
  - GPS Coordinates (with accuracy - accuracy is set to 20km if observation geoprivacy is obscured)
  - Date Observed
  - Observer Name and iNaturalist login
  - DNA Barcode ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1 (if present)
  - GenBank Accession Number (if present)
  - Provisional Species Name (if present)
  - Mushroom Observer URL (if present, formatted in simplest possible URL form)
  - Microscopy Performed (if present)
  - Traditional or Mobile Photography (if present)
  - Observation Notes
- Outputs labels to console for quick viewing
- Optionally creates formatted RTF files for high-quality printing
- Handles special characters and formatting (e.g., italics for scientific names, proper display of Â± symbol)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inat-herbarium-label-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd inat-herbarium-label-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requests python-dateutil beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing one or more iNaturalist observation IDs or URLs:

```
python inat.label.py <observation_number_or_url> [<observation_number_or_url> ...]
```

To generate an RTF file, use the `--rtf` option:

```
python inat.label.py <observation_number_or_url> [<observation_number_or_url> ...] --rtf <filename.rtf>
```

### Examples:

1. Generate label for a single observation:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751
   ```

2. Generate labels for multiple observations:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751 147249599 https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/106191917
   ```

3. Generate labels and save to an RTF file:
   ```
   python3 inat.label.py 183905751 147249599 --rtf two_labels.rtf
   ```

## Output

The script generates herbarium labels to the standard output by default, or labels are written to a RTF file if the --rtf command line argument is given.   RTF labels generally look more professional when printed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- requests
- python-dateutil
