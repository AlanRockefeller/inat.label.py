# Changelog

## 2.3

Added support for generating labels from Mushroom Observer (MO) observations, including MO-specific fields and QR codes.
The script now recognizes both iNaturalist and MO observation IDs and URLs.
Fixed the "Mirrored on iNaturalist at" line in the notes field to remove the redundant URL in parentheses, ensuring cleaner output.
Improved handling of HTML note parsing and corrected RTF escape mappings.

## 2.2

Added proper taxonomic rank formatting for scientific names, supporting:

Subgenus (subg.)
Section (sect.)
Subsection (subsect.)
Complex
Subspecies (subsp.)
Variety (var.)
Form (f.)

Improved scientific name construction with proper hierarchical formatting (e.g., "Mycena sect. Calodontes subsect. Purae")

Added more intelligent common name handling to drop this field if there is redundancy with any part of the scientific name

Added timeouts (10 seconds) to all API requests to prevent indefinite hanging if there is a network error
Implemented much better error handling for network requests
Added rate limiting detection and automatic retry logic
Improved error messages with specific HTTP status codes for better diagnosis

Fixed proper handling of subspecies formatting (e.g., "Amanita muscaria subsp. flavivolvata")
Fixed possible issue with the parse_date function's lambda parameter
Improved robustness when retrieving taxonomic hierarchical information

## 2.1

- Now removes "Imported by Mushroom Observer yyyy-mm-dd" from notes which is added when
importing iNaturalist observations into Mushroom Observer.   Thanks to Myles for making
this change and submitting a pull request!

## 2.0

- Bug fix suggested by James Chelin - large jobs no longer crash when called from cron

## 1.9

- Now can accept observation numbers in a file with the --file command line
argument.  The file can have observation numbers separated by commas, spaces
or newlines.

## 1.8

- Handles observations without names gracefully
- Now includes more observation fields in the label, including Herbarium Catalog Number,
Herbarium Name, Mycoportal ID and Voucher number(s)
- Shortens long locations

## 1.7

- When generating RTF labels it prints the iconic taxon along with the name -
fungi in blue, plants in green and everything else in white.   This will help
you quickly notice if an observation number is mistyped.
- Gracefully handles observations which don't have a date defined

## 1.6

- RTF output now includes a QR code which points to the iNaturalist URL
- When generating RTF labels it now prints the name of each species to standard output

## 1.5

- Added an optional command line switch to print out the iNaturalist URL's of
observations which are in California.   This makes it easy to add these
observations to the Mycomap CA Network project.
- Added a 1-second delay if there are more than 20 requests, which stops the
iNaturalist API from denying requests for large label printing jobs.  Now it
works well even if you are printing hundreds of labels at a time.

## 1.4

- Fixed microscopy field support
- Improved handling of dates
- Removed unnecessary pytz library

Still need to fix encoding of unusual characters in the location.

## [1.2] - 2024-06-28

### Added
- Handles special characters and formatting better, especially of the Location and Notes fields
- Implemented improved date parsing functionality with timezone support, ensuring more accurate 
and consistent handling of dates across different timezones

## [1.1] - [Previous release 2024-06-27]

Version 1.1 improves formatting, adds support for LSU, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1 DNA barcodes and 
gracefully handles obscured locations.

## [1.0] - [Initial release 2024-06-26]

- Initial release
