# Changelog

## 1,7

- When generating RTF labels it prints the iconic taxon along with the name -
fungi in blue, plants in green and everything else in white.   This will help
you quickly notice if an observation number is mistyped.
- Gracefully handles observations which don't have a date defined

## 1.6

- RTF output now includes a QR code which points to the iNaturalist URL
- When generating RTF labels it now prints the name of each species to standard output

## 1.5

- Added an optional command line switch to print out the iNaturalist URL's of
observations which are in California.   This makes it easy to add these
observations to the Mycomap CA Network project.
- Added a 1-second delay if there are more than 20 requests, which stops the
iNaturalist API from denying requests for large label printing jobs.  Now it
works well even if you are printing hundreds of labels at a time.
