# Changelog


## 2.8
October 1, 2025

- **Major Performance Improvements**: Implemented intelligent rate limiting with burst allowance for small jobs and smooth spacing for large batches, significantly improving API efficiency
- **Advanced Taxon Caching**: Added batched taxon-details caching system with background thread processing to reduce API calls and improve speed
- **Optimized Taxon Fetching**: Only fetch taxon details when needed for specific taxonomic ranks (subspecies, variety, form, section, subsection, subgenus), reducing unnecessary API calls
- **Enhanced Scientific Name Formatting**: Improved italicization handling with proper formatting markers for RTF, PDF, and console output
- **Better Common Name Handling**: Refined logic to avoid redundant common names that match parts of scientific names
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages to stderr with better cross-platform color support
- **Web Server Compatibility**: Modified colorama initialization to preserve ANSI colors when piping to web servers
- **Code Quality**: Renamed variables for clarity and improved documentation

## 2.7
September 30, 2025

- Uses parallel processing to vastly speed up requests for multiple labels.
- Improved formatting of Mushroom Observer labels.
- If there are errors we wait up to 30 seconds instead of exiting without creating all the labels the user requested.
- Give a report on the success of our label generation
- Better error messages

## 2.6
September 30, 2025

- Implemented connection pooling for more efficient and reliable API requests.
- GPS accuracy is now displayed in kilometers when the accuracy is over 1000 meters.
- RTF output has been improved with better spacing.
- Location formatting has been improved to standardize on "USA" instead of "US".

## 2.5

- Added --pdf option to save labels in PDF format - more compatibility, especially with Mac.   Uses the same font - Liberation Serif.
- Labels are kept together and will not split across columns or pages.
- QR codes in PDF are placed intelligently to save space. For short notes, the QR code is to the right of the notes. For long notes, it is below.
- Removed the iNaturalist URL: header because it's already obvious that it's an iNaturalist URL.
- Improved font handling for PDF output - now uses "Liberation Serif" font if available, otherwise falls back to a default font ("Times-Roman").
- Refactored the code for better readability and maintainability and reduced code duplication by creating a generic API fetching function.

## 2.4

Now checks for the Species Name Override observation field - if present it
prints it on the label and also overrides the iNaturalist consensus name on
the label.  Thanks to Ryan Peace for the suggestion!

Adds an additional blank line between labels to make them easier to cut.

Updated to support the new Mushroom Observer URL format -
https://mushroomobserver.org/obs/12345.

## 2.3

Added support for generating labels from Mushroom Observer (MO) observations, including MO-specific fields and QR codes.
The script now recognizes both iNaturalist and MO observation IDs and URLs.
Fixed the "Mirrored on iNaturalist at" line in the notes field to remove the redundant URL in parentheses, ensuring cleaner output.
Improved handling of HTML note parsing and corrected RTF escape mappings.

## 2.2

Added proper taxonomic rank formatting for scientific names, supporting:

Subgenus (subg.)
Section (sect.)
Subsection (subsect.)
Complex
Subspecies (subsp.)
Variety (var.)
Form (f.)

Improved scientific name construction with proper hierarchical formatting (e.g., "Mycena sect. Calodontes subsect. Purae")

Added more intelligent common name handling to drop this field if there is redundancy with any part of the scientific name

Added timeouts (10 seconds) to all API requests to prevent indefinite hanging if there is a network error
Implemented much better error handling for network requests
Added rate limiting detection and automatic retry logic
Improved error messages with specific HTTP status codes for better diagnosis

Fixed proper handling of subspecies formatting (e.g., "Amanita muscaria subsp. flavivolvata")
Fixed possible issue with the parse_date function's lambda parameter
Improved robustness when retrieving taxonomic hierarchical information

## 2.1

- Now removes "Imported by Mushroom Observer yyyy-mm-dd" from notes which is added when
importing iNaturalist observations into Mushroom Observer.   Thanks to Myles for making
this change and submitting a pull request!

## 2.0

- Bug fix suggested by James Chelin - large jobs no longer crash when called from cron

## 1.9

- Now can accept observation numbers in a file with the --file command line
argument.  The file can have observation numbers separated by commas, spaces
or newlines.

## 1.8

- Handles observations without names gracefully
- Now includes more observation fields in the label, including Herbarium Catalog Number,
Herbarium Name, Mycoportal ID and Voucher number(s)
- Shortens long locations

## 1.7

- When generating RTF labels it prints the iconic taxon along with the name -
fungi in blue, plants in green and everything else in white.   This will help
you quickly notice if an observation number is mistyped.
- Gracefully handles observations which don't have a date defined

## 1.6

- RTF output now includes a QR code which points to the iNaturalist URL
- When generating RTF labels it now prints the name of each species to standard output

## 1.5

- Added an optional command line switch to print out the iNaturalist URL's of
observations which are in California.   This makes it easy to add these
observations to the Mycomap CA Network project.
- Added a 1-second delay if there are more than 20 requests, which stops the
iNaturalist API from denying requests for large label printing jobs.  Now it
works well even if you are printing hundreds of labels at a time.

## 1.4

- Fixed microscopy field support
- Improved handling of dates
- Removed unnecessary pytz library

Still need to fix encoding of unusual characters in the location.

## [1.2] - 2024-06-28

### Added
- Handles special characters and formatting better, especially of the Location and Notes fields
- Implemented improved date parsing functionality with timezone support, ensuring more accurate 
and consistent handling of dates across different timezones

## [1.1] - [Previous release 2024-06-27]

Version 1.1 improves formatting, adds support for LSU, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1 DNA barcodes and 
gracefully handles obscured locations.

## [1.0] - [Initial release 2024-06-26]

- Initial release
